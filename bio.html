   <p class="bio">I am 24 years old. I live in Roxbury. I like to create multimedia art pieces that reflect community issues and intuitive feelings. Traveling is an ongoing goal. I love to learn about cultures and perspectives. I come from a "blended" family filled with half and step sisters and brothers. I have recently lossed a sister and this year I am taking the time to learn about loss and how to deal with it. There isn't a guide when it comes to dealing with loss so everyday is a new adventure for me. I have a semester left of undergrad at the Museum of Fine Arts and I am excited to turn the page when it comes to my education, career and art practice. </p>
